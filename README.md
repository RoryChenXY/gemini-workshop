# Workshop: Build with Gemini

This workshop teaches how to build with Gemini using the Gemini API and Python SDK.

> [!NOTE]
> I recommend first going through the notebooks and exercises in the [notebooks](https://github.com/patrickloeber/workshop-build-with-gemini/blob/main/notebooks/) folder. You'll find the same notebooks but with the solutions in [solutions](https://github.com/patrickloeber/workshop-build-with-gemini/blob/main/solutions/).

**Prerequisites**: You need an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey). Everything can be done on the free tier.
